# BitlockerCrackPy
Windows-only python code that attempts to bruteforce bitlocker.

This program is insanely slow, runs on a single core (but you can open multiple instances) and can attempt the same 48-digit code multiple times, reducing it's efficency.
I highly recommend using https://github.com/kkamagui/bitleaker or https://github.com/e-ago/bitcracker instead.
